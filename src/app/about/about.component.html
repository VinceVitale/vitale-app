                I graduated with a bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Central Missouri. I believe that
                as a problem solver, that computer science was the right path for me. I enjoy the thrill of the hunt
                when it comes to researching problems, finding the core issue, solving them effectively and with great
                detail so that I can convey the information I find to others about my resolutions. I'm currently looking
                for my first full time position as a Junior Software Engineer that will let me take both my skills and
                passion and utilize them to bring value to the company that I work with. In my pastime, I enjoy spending
                time with my cat, relaxing with my family, baking, playing video games, and self-improvement. I built
                this website using HTML & CSS, TypeScript, and Angular with Angular Material as a framework to display
                my software engineering skills.
