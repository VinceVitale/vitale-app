        <div style="display: absolute; width: 555px; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px;">
            <p>I graduated with a bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Central Missouri. I believe
                that
                as a problem solver, that computer science was the right path for me.</p>

            <p>I enjoy the thrill of the hunt when it comes to researching problems, finding the core issue, solving
                them effectively and with great
                detail so that I can convey the information I find to others about my resolutions. I'm currently
                looking
                for my first full time position as a Junior Software Engineer that will let me take both my skills
                and
                passion and utilize them to bring value to the company that I work with.</p>

            <p>In my pastime, I enjoy spending
                time with my cat, relaxing with my family, baking, playing video games, and self-improvement. I
                built
                this website using HTML & CSS, TypeScript, and Angular with Angular Material as a framework to
                display
                my software engineering skills.</p>
